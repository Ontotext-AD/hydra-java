Performing a release to Maven and Openshift involves the following steps

Publish to Maven Central

Add Sonatype password to server ossrh in local settings.xml

<settings>
  <servers>
    <server>
      <id>ossrh</id>
      <username>XXX</username>
      <password>XXX</password>
    </server>
  </servers>
</settings>

Release to Sonatype with Github password and gpg passphrase:
mvn release:prepare release:perform -Dusername=XXX -Dpassword=XXX -Darguments="-Dgpg.passphrase=XXX"

The above command should automatically release from staging repo https://oss.sonatype.org/
Details:

In case that signing failed and the build asks for the gpg passphrase over and over again, perform the release once more:
mvn release:perform -Darguments="-Dgpg.passphrase=XXX"

Publish to Openshift

Check that new hydra-java release has become available in Central:
http://search.maven.org/#search%7Cga%7C1%7Chydra-service
Adjust latest version in openshift project: ssh://549fcacc5973ca16e1000025@jbosswildfly-escalon.rhcloud.com/~/git/jbosswildfly.git/
Run deployment build (if necessary; runs automatically every hour): https://jenkins-escalon.rhcloud.com/job/jbosswildfly-build/

The openshift project has its own web.xml, configuration changes must be applied there, too.
